# Personal Website

## Introduction

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website! This website serves as a showcase of my work, skills, and experiences. If you're interested in creating a similar portfolio site, you're in the right place.

## Technologies Used

This portfolio site is built with `Hugo`, a fast and flexible static site generator. The theme used is the `Stack` theme, which provides a clean and modern layout to showcase your projects and information.

**Template demo:** [**demo.stack.jimmycai.com**](https://demo.stack.jimmycai.com)

## Getting Started

If you want to replicate this portfolio site, you can start with the Hugo Stack theme starter template. Follow these steps:

1. Go to the Hugo Stack theme GitHub repository.

**Template:** [**CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack-starter**](https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack-starter)

2. Click on the `Use this template` button to create a new repository with the same structure.
3. Clone your newly created repository to your local machine.

**Now you have the basic structure to kickstart your portfolio site!**

## Making Changes to the Site

To make changes to this site and view them locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-portfolio-repo.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd your-portfolio-repo
```

3. Make the necessary changes to the `content`, `layout`, or any other aspect of the site.

>[!TIP]
>To view your changes `locally`, run Hugo's development server:

```bash
hugo server
```

4. This will start a `local server`, and you can view your site at [**http://localhost:1313**](http://localhost:1313) in your web browser.
5. Once you are satisfied with the changes, **stop the Hugo server** Press <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>.
6. Build the site using the following command:

```bash
hugo
```

This command generates the `static files` in the public directory.
Finally, publish the changed files to your `hosting server` **(e.g., Nginx)** to make your updated portfolio live.
Feel free to explore and customize the theme to suit your preferences and showcase your unique style on your portfolio website!
